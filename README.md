# Datacamp Notes

These are my personal notes of several data science and engineering courses from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

Datacamp is organized in single *courses* and *tracks*, which contain several single courses arranged in a learning order. Each one of the tracks/courses I did and considered interesting has a dedicated folder with its guide (markdown), code and additional material.

List of courses / tracks:

- [Analyzing IoT Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-iot-data-in-python): [`Course_IoT`](Course_IoT).
<!--
- [Data Engineer with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-engineer-with-python): [`Track_DataEngineer`](Track_DataEngineer).
