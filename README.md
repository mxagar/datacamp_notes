# Datacamp Notes

These are my personal notes of several data science and engineering courses from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com).

Datacamp is organized in single *courses* and *tracks*, which contain several single courses arranged in a learning order. Each one of the tracks/courses I did and considered interesting has a dedicated folder with its guide (markdown), code and additional material.

List of courses / tracks:

- [Analyzing IoT Data in Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-iot-data-in-python): [`Course_IoT`](Course_IoT).
- [Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/extreme-gradient-boosting-with-xgboost): [`Course_XGBoost`](Course_XGBoost).
<!--
- [Data Engineer with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-engineer-with-python): [`Track_DataEngineer`](Track_DataEngineer).
-->

I have done some other courses from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com), but the notes are located in domain-specific repositories I had before; for instance:

- [spark_big_data_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/spark_big_data_guide)
- [space_exploration](https://github.com/mxagar/space_exploration)
- [sql_guide](https://github.com/mxagar/sql_guide)
- [data_science_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/data_science_udacity)
- etc.
